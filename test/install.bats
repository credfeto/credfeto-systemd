# Regression test: install must actually invoke every install.d/ step it
# ships. install itself is not run end-to-end here - most steps mutate real
# system state (pacman, sshd, sysctl, ...) and are exercised individually by
# their own bats suites instead; this only asserts the wiring is present.
